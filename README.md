# KNN_algorithm
This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.
Pearson's Correlation Coefficient: helps you find out the relationship between two quantities. It gives you the measure of the strength of association between two variables. The value of Pearson's Correlation Coefficient can be between -1 to +1. 1 means that they are highly correlated and 0 means no correlation.
A heat map is a two-dimensional representation of information with the help of colors. Heat maps can help the user visualize simple or complex information.

Train Test Split : To have unknown datapoints to test the data rather than testing with the same points with which the model was trained. This helps capture the model performance much better.
Cross Validation: When model is split into training and testing it can be possible that specific type of data point may go entirely into either training or testing portion. This would lead the model to perform poorly. Hence over-fitting and underfitting problems can be well avoided with cross validation techniques.
KNN can be used for both classification and regression predictive problems. However, it is more widely used in classification problems in the industry. To evaluate any technique we generally look at 3 important aspects:

1. Ease to interpret output

2. Calculation time

3. Predictive Power
implementation of a KNN model by following the below steps:

Load the data
Initialise the value of k
For getting the predicted class, iterate from 1 to total number of training data points
Calculate the distance between test data and each row of training data. Here we will use Euclidean distance as our distance metric since itâ€™s the most popular method. The other metrics that can be used are Chebyshev, cosine, etc.
Sort the calculated distances in ascending order based on distance values
Get top k rows from the sorted array
Get the most frequent class of these rows
Return the predicted class
